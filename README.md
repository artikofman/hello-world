My first step in real world. Get in GitHub.

Hi. My name is Orik.
Right now i am doing my first steps out in real world.

I am a CS student, learning at Ariel-University (Israel). 
I also work in company that develops municipal management softwares.

I don't realy know right now what exactly i will and want to do in my GitHub account.
I make this step as a part of programming-worlds' doorway.
